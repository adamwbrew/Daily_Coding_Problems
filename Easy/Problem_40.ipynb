    "### rand7() solution\n",
    "This code implements the `rand7()` function in Python, which generates a random integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, using the `rand5()` function that generates a random integer between 1 and 5 inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `rand7()` function first generates two random integers between 1 and 5 inclusive using `rand5()`. It then uses these two integers to generate a random integer between 0 and 24 inclusive by multiplying the first integer by 5 and adding the second integer. This generates a uniform distribution of integers between 0 and 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the function discards any generated integers that are greater than or equal to 21, since these integers cannot be mapped uniformly to integers between 1 and 7 inclusive. This step ensures that the remaining integers (0 to 20) are uniformly distributed between 1 and 7 inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function uses modular arithmetic to map the remaining integers (0 to 20) to integers between 1 and 7 inclusive. Specifically, it takes the remainder after dividing the integer by 7, and then adds 1 to ensure that the resulting integer is between 1 and 7 inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this implementation should generate random integers between 1 and 7 inclusive with a relatively uniform probability distribution, although it is worth noting that there is a small chance of the function getting stuck in the `while` loop if `rand5()` generates values that repeatedly exceed the limit of 21."
