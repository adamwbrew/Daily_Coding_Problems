    "# Problem 39\n",
    "We can determine how \"out of order\" an array `A` is by counting the number of inversions it has. Two elements` A[i]` and `A[j]` form an inversion if `A[i] > A[j]` but `i < j`. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may assume each element in the array is distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]` has three inversions: `(2, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, and `(4, 3)`. The array `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` has ten inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion."

    "### counting_inversions(A) solution\n",
    "The function `counting_inversions` takes an array `A` as input and returns the number of inversions in the list and prints them to the console. An inversion in a list is defined as a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `A[i] > A[j]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function uses a two-pointer approach to iterate through the array and find the inversions. The `left` pointer starts at the beginning of the array, and the `right` pointer starts at the end of the array. The function checks if `A[left]` is greater than `A[right]`, and if so, appends the pair `(A[left], A[right])` to the `inversions` list. Then, the function decrements right by 1 and checks if `left` is equal to `right`. If `left` is equal to `right`, it increments left by 1 and sets `right` to the end of the array. This process continues until `left` equals `right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then checks if the `inversions` list is empty. If it is, it prints a message saying that no `inversions` were found. If inversions is not empty, the function prints a message saying how many inversions were found, followed by a list of the inversion pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this function is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the input array `A`. This is because the function iterates through the array once using a two-pointer approach, and the time taken to append to the `inversions` list and print the results is O(1). The space complexity of this function is O(k), where k is the number of inversions in the array. This is because the function stores the inversion pairs in the `inversions` list, which can have a maximum size of k."
