    "Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, break up the string into multiple lines such that each line has a length of `k` or less. You must break it up so that words don't break across lines. Each line has to have the maximum possible amount of words. If there's no way to break the text up, then return `null`.\n",

    "### `relaxed_justify(string, k)` solution\n",
    "This code is implementing a relaxed version of text justification algorithm to split a given string into multiple lines such that each line has a length of at most `k` characters, without breaking words in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input parameters are a string `string` and an integer `k` indicating the maximum length allowed for each line. The code first splits the input `string` into individual words using the `split` function, and stores them in a list called `words`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It initializes a list called lines with an empty string element. The algorithm then iterates over each `word` in the `words` list, and checks whether adding it to the current `line` in `lines` will cause the `line` to exceed the maximum length `k`. If the `word` fits, it is added to the current `line`. If not, a new `line` is created and the current `word` is added to the new `line`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code checks whether a `word` is longer than the maximum length `k`, and if it is, it returns `None` indicating that it is not possible to break up the string as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the code returns the list of `lines` that were created, which contains the resulting broken up `string`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the algorithm is trying to break up the string into as many `lines` as possible, without breaking words in the middle, and ensuring that no line exceeds the maximum length allowed. The relaxed version allows for the last line to be shorter than `k`, if necessary."
