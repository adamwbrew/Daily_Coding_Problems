    "Conway's Game of Life takes place on an infinite two-dimensional board of square cells. Each cell is either dead or alive, and at each tick, the following rules apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.\n",
    "- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remains living.\n",
    "- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.\n",

    "- A cell neighbours another cell if it is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.\n",

    "Implement Conway's Game of Life. It should be able to be initialized with a starting list of live cell coordinates and the number of steps it should run for. Once initialized, it should print out the board state at each step. Since it's an infinite board, print out only the relevant coordinates, i.e. from the top-leftmost live cell to bottom-rightmost live cell.\n",

    "### Conway_Game(live_cells, steps) solution\n",
    "This code is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, which is a cellular automaton game. The game takes an initial configuration of living cells and evolves it through a number of steps based on a set of rules. The code consists of several functions that work together to play the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Board_Setup` function takes a list of living cells as input and creates a game board with these cells. It first determines the maximum and minimum values for the x and y coordinates of the living cells. It then creates a board that includes all cells within this range, with living cells represented by asterisks (`\"*\"`) and dead cells represented by periods (`\".\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Board_Print` function takes a game board as input and converts it into a string representation that can be printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Position_Endings` function creates a dictionary that maps numbers to their ordinal endings (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) based on the last digit of the number. This function is used to print the correct ordinal ending for each step of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Cell_Neighbors` function takes a cell and a game board as input and determines the number of living neighbors for that cell based on the game rules. It returns two values: the number of living neighbors and the current state of the cell (alive or dead).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Boundary_Check` function takes a list of living cells as input and creates a game board that includes a buffer zone around the living cells to account for possible future growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Update_Board` function takes a list of living cells as input and updates the game board based on the game rules. It first creates a new game board with a buffer zone using the `Boundary_Check` function. It then loops through each cell on the board and determines its new state based on the number of living neighbors. It returns two values: the updated game board and a list of new living cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Conway_Game` function is the main function that plays the game. It takes a list of living cells and the number of steps to play as input. It first creates the initial game board using the `Board_Setup` function and prints it to the console. It then loops through each step of the game, updating the board using the `Update_Board` function and printing the updated board to the console. If no living cells remain, the game ends and a message is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this code is O(nmk), where n is the number of rows in the game board, m is the number of columns in the game board, and k is the number of steps in the game. This is because the `Board_Setup` function and the `Boundary_Check` function both loop through all cells on the board, and the `Update_Board` function loops through all cells on the board for each step of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory space complexity of this code is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows in the game board and m is the number of columns in the game board. This is because the game board is represented as a list of lists, with each inner list containing m elements. The amount of memory required for the other data structures used in the code (e.g., lists of living cells and dictionaries) is negligible compared to the game board."
