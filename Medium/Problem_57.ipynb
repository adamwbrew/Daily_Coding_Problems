    "### `nonbiased_coin_filp()` solution\n",
    "This code contains two functions that simulate coin tosses. The first function `toss_biased()` generates a random number between `0` and `100`, multiplies it by `0.01` to get a decimal value between `0` and `1`, and uses this as the biased probability of the coin landing on heads. It then generates another random number between `0` and `1` and compares it to the biased probability. If the random number is less than the biased probability, the function returns `1` (heads). Otherwise, it returns `0` (tails).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second `function nonbiased_coin_filp()` uses the `toss_biased()` function to generate a set of tosses until it contains both `0` and `1`. Then, it randomly selects one of the tosses in the set to return, effectively simulating an unbiased coin toss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the second function creates a set of biased coin tosses until both possible outcomes have occurred, at which point it randomly selects one of the tosses to return. This results in an unbiased coin toss, since both possible outcomes have an equal chance of being selected."
