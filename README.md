# Daily Coding Problems

Hi there, this is my GitHub repository sharing all of the one off problems I have worked through based on **[Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)**. Daily Coding Problem is a great group that sends out one coding problem a day based on interview questions from big tech companies. It's a great way to practice for coding interviews and keep up your coding skills. Check out some of the my solutions to these problems in the files above. In each file I explain how the solution works based on the functionality of my code to make it easier for readers to understand how the solution came to be. 

### Here's an example problem from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/):

> There's a staircase with N steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
> For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
> 
> - 1, 1, 1, 1
> - 2, 1, 1
> - 1, 2, 1
> - 1, 1, 2
> - 2, 2 
> 
> What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time. Generalize your function to take in X.
