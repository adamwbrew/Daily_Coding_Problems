# Daily Coding Problems

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I'm sharing a collection of coding problems that I've tackled based on **[Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)**. If you haven't heard of it, Daily Coding Problem is a fantastic resource that sends out a daily coding challenge inspired by real interview questions from top tech companies. It's an excellent way to sharpen your coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

In this repository, you can find my solutions to these problems, neatly categorized into Daily Coding Problem difficulty levels of Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each folder contains multiple problem files where I've explained how I arrived at the solution through the functionality of my code. I've done my best to make it easy for readers to understand the logic behind each solution.

I hope you find my repository useful and informative. Happy coding!

## Example Problem
Here's the sample problem found on the homepage of [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/):

> There's a staircase with `N` steps, and you can climb `1` or `2` steps at a time. Given `N`, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
> For example, if `N` is `4`, then there are 5 unique ways:
> 
> - `1, 1, 1, 1`
> - `2, 1, 1`
> - `1, 2, 1`
> - `1, 1, 2`
> - `2, 2` 
> 
> What if, instead of being able to climb `1` or `2` steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers `X`? For example, if `X = {1, 3, 5}`, you could climb `1`, `3`, or `5` steps at a time. Generalize your function to take in `X`.

## Hard Problems

Here's an example of a **hard** problem from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/):

> Given an array of strictly the characters `'R'`, `'G'`, and `'B'`, segregate the values of the array so that all the Rs come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap elements of the array.
> 
> Do this in linear time and in-place.
> 
> For example, given the array `['G', 'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'R', 'G']`, it should become `['R', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'B', 'B']`.

## Medium Problems

Here's an example of a **medium** problem from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/):

> Conway's Game of Life takes place on an infinite two-dimensional board of square cells. Each cell is either dead or alive, and at each tick, the following rules apply:
> 
> - Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.
> - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remains living.
> - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
> - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
> - A cell neighbours another cell if it is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
> 
> Implement Conway's Game of Life. It should be able to be initialized with a starting list of live cell coordinates and the number of steps it should run for. Once initialized, it should print out the board state at each step. Since it's an infinite board, print out only the relevant coordinates, i.e. from the top-leftmost live cell to bottom-rightmost live cell.
> 
> You can represent a live cell with an asterisk (`*`) and a dead cell with a dot (`.`).

## Easy Problems

Here's an example of a **easy** problem from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/):

> Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.
> 
> For example, given `[(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)]`, you should return `2`.
