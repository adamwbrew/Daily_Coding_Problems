# Daily Coding Problems

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I'm sharing a collection of coding problems that I've tackled based on **[Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)**. If you haven't heard of it, Daily Coding Problem is a fantastic resource that sends out a daily coding challenge inspired by real interview questions from top tech companies. It's an excellent way to sharpen your coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

In this repository, you can find my solutions to these problems, neatly categorized into Daily Coding Problem difficulty levels of Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each folder contains multiple problem files where I've explained how I arrived at the solution through the functionality of my code. I've done my best to make it easy for readers to understand the logic behind each solution.

I hope you find my repository useful and informative. Happy coding!

## Example Problem
Here's the sample problem found on the homepage of [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/):

> There's a staircase with `N` steps, and you can climb `1` or `2` steps at a time. Given `N`, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
> For example, if `N` is `4`, then there are 5 unique ways:
> 
> - `1, 1, 1, 1`
> - `2, 1, 1`
> - `1, 2, 1`
> - `1, 1, 2`
> - `2, 2` 
> 
> What if, instead of being able to climb `1` or `2` steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers `X`? For example, if `X = {1, 3, 5}`, you could climb `1`, `3`, or `5` steps at a time. Generalize your function to take in `X`.

## Hard Problems

Here's an example of a **hard** problem from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/):

> Given an array of strictly the characters `'R'`, `'G'`, and `'B'`, segregate the values of the array so that all the Rs come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap elements of the array.
> 
> Do this in linear time and in-place.
> 
> For example, given the array `['G', 'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'R', 'G']`, it should become `['R', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'B', 'B']`.

## Medium Problems

Here's an example of a **medium** problem from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/):

> You are given an array of non-negative integers that represents a two-dimensional elevation map where each element is unit-width wall and the integer is the height. Suppose it will rain and all spots between two walls get filled up.
> 
> Compute how many units of water remain trapped on the map in O(N) time and O(1) space.
> 
> For example, given the input `[2, 1, 2]`, we can hold `1` unit of water in the middle.
> 
> Given the input `[3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5]`, we can hold `3` units in the first index, `2` in the second, and `3` in the fourth index (we cannot hold `5` since it would run off to the left), so we can trap `8` units of water.

## Easy Problems

Here's an example of a **easy** problem from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/):

> You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last `N` order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:
> 
> - `record(order_id)`: adds the order_id to the log
> - `get_last(i)`: gets the ith last element from the log. `i` is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to `N`.
> 
> You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.
